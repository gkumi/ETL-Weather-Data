# ETL-Weather-Data
Historical Weather Forecast Comparison to Actuals
In this Project I created an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis
I used the weather data package provided by the open source project wttr.in, a web service that provides weather forecast information in a simple and text-based format.
